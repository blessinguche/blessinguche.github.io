# Blessing Uche — Portfolio & ML Research  

Hi, I’m **Blessing Uche** — a Computer Science student at Keele University (expected First Class) and software engineer with experience across **frontend, backend, and AI research**.  

This repo powers my personal site: [blessinguche.github.io](https://blessinguche.github.io).  
It collects my **projects, experiments, and 1-page research notes**.  

---

## 🔬 Current Focus
- **AI/ML Research Engineering** → deep learning, transformers, diffusion models, reinforcement learning.  
- **Software Engineering** → building APIs, dashboards, and scalable systems.  
- **Bridging Research & Practice** → turning academic ideas into real tools.

## 📂 Projects & Experiments  

### 🔹 Software Engineering
- **[Games API](https://blessing-games.onrender.com/api)** — REST API with CRUD ops (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL).  
- **M&A Dashboard (Inchcape)** — Databricks SQL + React.js dashboard for customer insights.  
- **Finovance eCommerce Platform** — React.js, Node.js, Postgres with a custom search + checkout flow.  

### 🔹 AI/ML Experiments
- **Vision Transformer on CIFAR-10** *(in progress)* — exploring what parts of ViTs actually matter.  
- **Diffusion vs GANs (64×64 faces)** *(planned)* — comparing training stability + sample quality.  
- **Bandit-based Hyperparameter Tuning** *(planned)* — testing if UCB beats grid search for model selection.  

Each experiment includes:  
- Code + Colab notebook  
- 1-page write-up (methods, results, key insights)
